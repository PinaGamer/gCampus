# gCampus
This repository contains a script to visualize and solve graphically the gCampus' problem: https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/4284486/dashboard#s=p2

The running is simple: The user introduces the number of offices and roads and the script will generate a random graph using [Cytoscape JS library](http://js.cytoscape.org/) and then it will check if graph contains some inefficient roads.
